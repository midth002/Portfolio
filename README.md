# Portfolio

## Description

Hello, my name is Andrew Midthun and welcome to my full stack developer portfolio. Inside the website you will the progress of my web developer portfolio with an about me section, a project section showcasing my projects (which are coming soon) and how to contact me. I worked on creating links on the navbar for the users to skip to those sections that they would like to see. I made the website responsive to small phones and tablets and various different screen sizes. Making this an easy portfolio website to navigate and find information about me and what I will be doing for my porfolio.
